Write a query to display for each player - the player_id, amount_spent_usd, and a new calculation representing the amount spent in euros, with exchange rate of 0.8.
Allow us to elaborate, The amount_spent_usd column represents the amount of money spent by each player in USD so if the current exchange rate is 0.8, the calculation would be amount_spent_usd * 0.8.

-- MYSQL 
SELECT player_id, amount_spent_usd, amount_spent_usd * 0.8 AS 'amount_spent_euro'
FROM players
-- MSSQL 
SELECT player_id, amount_spent_usd, amount_spent_usd * 0.8 AS 'amount_spent_euro'
FROM players
-- POSTGRES 
SELECT player_id, amount_spent_usd, amount_spent_usd * 0.8 AS "amount_spent_euro"
FROM players
Write a query to display the player_id, last_name, first_name, amount_spent_usd, installed_games, and a new calculation representing the average amount spent on each game (amount_spent_usd / installed_games)

-- MYSQL

	   installed_games, amount_spent_usd / installed_games AS 'average_amount_paid'

	   installed_games, amount_spent_usd / installed_games AS "average_amount_paid"
FROM players
Write a query to display for each player - the player_id, email_address, installed_games, uninstalled_games, and a new calculation representing the ratio between installed and uninstalled games (uninstalled_games / installed_games)

-- MYSQL 
SELECT player_id, email_address, installed_games, uninstalled_games,
       uninstalled_games / installed_games AS 'installation_ratio'

       uninstalled_games / installed_games AS 'installation_ratio'
FROM  players
-- POSTGRES 
SELECT player_id, email_address, installed_games, uninstalled_games,
       uninstalled_games / installed_games AS "installation_ratio"
FROM  players
Write a query to display the:

a. player_id

b. player's first_name concatenated with his/hers last_name

-- MYSQL 
SELECT player_id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS 'full_name'
FROM players
-- MSSQL 
SELECT player_id, first_name + ' ' + last_name AS 'full_name'
FROM players
-- POSTGRES 
SELECT player_id, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS "full_name"
FROM players
Write a query to display the:

a. player_id

b. email_address

c. country concatenated with city and street_address

d. total playing time in hours (total_playing_minutes / 60)

-- MYSQL 
SELECT player_id, email_address, 
       CONCAT(country, ' ', city, ' ', street_address) AS 'full_address',
       total_playing_minutes / 60 AS 'total_playing_hours'
FROM   players
-- MSSQL

FROM   players
Write a query to display the following string for each player :

‘full name preferred language is preferred_language’

(full name is the result of concatenating first_name and last_name)

for example:

-- MYSQL 
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ' ,last_name, '  preferred language is :', preferred_language) AS 'player preferred_language'
